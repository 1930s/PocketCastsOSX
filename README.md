# Pocket Casts for Mac
An unoffical native wrapper for Pocket Casts

* Turns [Pocket Casts web player](http://play.pocketcasts.com) into a Mac app with a dock icon and full screen mode
* Use the keyboard's Play/Pause (F8) to control the app
* Use Skip (F7) goes back 10 seconds, Skip forward (F9) goes forward 30 seconds

### Where can I get it?

### Why doesn't it use my keyboard's Play and Skip buttons and headphone remote?
That would be awesome. If you know how, please submit a pull request or get in touch. Until then, use the keyboard light buttons (on F5 and F6). Not perfect. You'll get used to it. 

### Anything else?
Shoutout to [Kenneth](http://github.com/auchenberg) for digging out the Javascript functions and @luryus for hooking up the media keyboard keys
