# PocketCastsOSX
An unoffical OSX wrapper for Pocketcasts

* Makes play.pocketcasts.com a separate OSX app
* Use "keyboard light down" button (on F5) to play/pause
* Use "keyboard light up" button (on F6) to skip 30 seconds

### Where can I get it? 
https://github.com/mortenjust/PocketCastsOSX/releases

### Why doesn't it use the actual Play and Skip buttons and headphone remote?
That would be awesome. If you know how, please submit a pull request or get in touch

### Anything else?
Shoutout to [Kenneth](http://github.com/auchenberg) for digging out the Javascript functions
